Or at least, that is the handle I’ve been using for the longest time. I’ve known a lot of people through many different hobbies. But one day, I realized that each and every one of those people only saw the face I decided to show them. And that drowned me under an immense feeling of loneliness.</p> <p>So I decided that there wasn’t a better place for me to show all my faces, than the one that set the stage in the first place. The whole wide web!</p> <p>Here you will find the recollection of my slow descent to madness, as I remember every little corner of the internet I found myself in. And most importantly, the people I met there.</p> <p>I’ll also be posting my impressions of the books I’m reading, and revisiting some of my favorite anime.</p> </body></html>
