Welcome! I'm **Sinnelleos**. Or at least, that's the handle I've been using the longest. With it, I've met quite a few people through my hobbies. But most of them only know who I was during that particular endeavour. It kind of fills me with **loneliness**.

So I decided the best place to stitch together all my masks, is the very stage that made them possible: the whole wide web!

Here, you will find the recollection of my slow descent into madness as I remember every little corner of the internet I found myself in. And most importantly, the **people I met there.**

I'll also be posting my impressions of the books I'm reading, and revisiting some of my favorite anime.

Hope you enjoy your stay, and thanks for reading.
