Welcome in! I'm Sinnelleos. Or at least, that is the handle I've been using for the longest time. I've known a lot of people through many different hobbies. But one day, I realized that each and every one of those people only saw the face I decided to show them. And that drowned me under an immense feeling of loneliness.

So I decided that there wasn't a better place for me to show all my faces, than the one that set the stage in the first place. The whole wide web!

Here you will find the recollection of my slow descent to madness, as I remember every little corner of the internet I found myself in. And most importantly, the people I met there.

I'll also be posting my impressions of the books I'm reading, and revisiting some of my favorite anime.
