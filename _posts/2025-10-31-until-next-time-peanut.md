I was debating wherever or not to write about this, because it's been pretty literary in here so far. But I guess this is _the_ place to nerd out. Plus, Peanut is the player I've been supporting the longest.

I didn't watch enough LCK in 2015 to get a glimpse of Peanut in his early days at NaJin. So the truth is, I first became a fan of the team where he was later able to showcase his skill to the world, the **ROX Tigers** (known as the _KOO Tigers_ in 2015). How did I become a fan? Pretty simple. I always cheer for the underdogs. And SKT having already won Worlds two years prior, I really wanted the Tigers to win this one. Only later did I realize how unique their chemistry was, and how cheerful and skillful they were. Sadly, it wasn't meant to be. They fell 1-3 to what eventually would become the the <u>greatest esport team ever</u>.

It was the following year when Han "**Peanut**" Wangho made it into the roster, taking Hojin's place. It was quite funny watching someone small guy (even by korean gamer standards) tear up the rift. And **always** with a smile on his face. The semifinal where they ultimately fell against STK again is in contention for one of the best bo5s of League. I really believed this was it. So when their nexus exploded in game five, that's when I decided I had enough of Faker and SKT. I _needed_ them to lose. So naturally, I also became a Samsung fan during those finals. Unfortunately for my hate-watching, after another four grueling games, SKT rised again 3-2. The image of the defeated Crown, the last to get up from his chair, is imprinted in my memories.

The next year, unfortunately the tigers split up. GorillA & PraY went to Longzhu gaming, Smeb to KT Rolster, Kuro to Afreeca Freecs, and Peanut, thanks to his impressive performances, earned his place in the grand SK Telecom T1. And that's where my dilemma began. As I said, I was really tired of watching SKT win. And cheering for Samsung the year prior, with Ambition and Crown growing up on me, I ended up celebrating their win. While Ambition is a player that I admire, Crown is the guy I feel more inclined to support. He was so relieved for winning. He was so crushed for losing the year prior. On his interviews you could feel how much it all meant to him. Such a kindred spirit. I'm sorry, I just love cheering on earnest people, I'm a cheerleader at heart.

Unfortunately, having my wish granted of watching Ambition & Crown win, and SKT lose, came with a huge price. And that was the heartbraking scene of Faker sobbing on stage, and watching Peanut holding this awkward smile. He was on ROX, lost to SKT. Went to SKT, lost to Samsung. Then he went to Gen.G (formerly Samsung) and lost to BLG & DRX. Went to HLE, and lost to Gen.G. And now he's gone to mandatory military service. Competition is really cruel sometimes. Even if he's the second player with most LCK titles, only behind Faker, he could never lift the Worlds trophy. The last standing tiger. The youngest to join the team, to one of the most long lasting pros carrying their flag. For me, Peanut is always going to be the greatest jungler. I learned to cheer for SKT just for you, I even played with your translated ign for a while, rip SKT T1 Cacahuate.

I'll leave you with my favorite video of the tigers.
