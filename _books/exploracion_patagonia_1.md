> Between 1876 and 1877, at 24 years of age, Francisco Pascasio Moreno undertook his fourth Patagonian journey. His earlier expeditions had provided valuable experience, particularly through his contact with Indigenous communities, but it was this fourth journey that ultimately established his lasting legacy.
